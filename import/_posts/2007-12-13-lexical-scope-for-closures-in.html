<p>Ayende has a post on <a href="http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2007/12/13/Javascript-lexical-scopes-and-what-your-momma-thought-you-about.aspx">working with closures in JavaScript</a>. Basically, when looking at capturing variables in a closure, you need to be careful with lexical scope. In JS the scope is a function, so if you want to capture a variable that will change values during&nbsp;the scope of the function, you will need to reference it via another function.</p> <p>From Ayende's example, where i is set in a loop, this:</p><pre>if( nums[i] % 2 == 0)
    {
      var tmpNum = nums[i];
      <b>alertLink.onclick = function() { alert('EVEN: '+ tmpNum ); };</b>
      //tmpNum will be bound to its value when the loop exits.
    } ...
</pre>
<p>Needs to become this:</p><pre>if( nums[i] % 2 == 0)
    {
      <b>var act = function(tmpEVEN)
      {
        alertLink.onclick = function() { alert('EVEN: '+tmpEVEN); };
      };
      act(nums[i]);</b>
      //tmpEVEN will be bound to nums[i] at the point where act(nums[i]) is called.
    } ...
</pre>
<p>Ayende notes that in C#, the first example will work as its lexical scope is the current block (I think :S). In JavaScript, we need to use a function to get the correct scope.</p>
