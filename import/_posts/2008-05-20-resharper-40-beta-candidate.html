<p><i><b>Update 2008-05-22</b>: The <a href="http://resharper.blogspot.com/2008/05/resharper-4-beta.html">real beta release</a> has just been announced. It is the same build (804) as the beta candidate, which pretty much answers my question below on the difference between the two :).</i></p>

<p><a href="http://www.intellij.net/forums/thread.jspa?messageID=5214869&tstart=0#5214869">R# 4.0 beta candidate has been released</a>. I'm not quite sure of the difference between a beta and a beta <i>candidate</i>, but I'm assuming its better than a standard nightly build :)</p>

<p>You can get it <a href="http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/ReSharper/ReSharper+4.0+Nightly+Builds">here</a>, build 804. I've had a pretty good experience with most of the &quot;works here&quot; builds, so am looking forward to firing this up today :)</p>
