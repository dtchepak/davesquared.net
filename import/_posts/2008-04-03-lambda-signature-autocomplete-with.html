<p>Just found something helpful while using a recent <a href="http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/ReSharper/ReSharper+4.0+Nightly+Builds">nightly build of ReSharper 4</a> (build 4.0.765.1). When dealing with unfamiliar parts of the .NET Framework I sometimes have to look up a method signature to get the right arguments and return value for a lambda expression.</p>

<p>I had this problem again today when I had to type in a <code>ValidationEventHandler</code> from <code>System.Xml.Schema</code>. What's the signature? Well, hit <code>Ctrl + Alt</code> and ReSharper brings up an autocomplete dialog that looks a bit like this:</p>

<a href="/images/fromblogger/s1600-h-lambdaHelp.png"><img src="/images/fromblogger/s400-lambdaHelp.png" border="0" alt="" /></a>

<p>The top dialog shows the signature of the <code>Validate()</code> method I am writing arguments for, while the bottom shows a smart autocomplete for my current parameter. Hit enter and ReSharper generates the lambda stub for me, <code>(sender,e) => </code>. Yes, I know <code>Ctrl + Alt</code> has been around forever, but in this instance I found it extra helpful. :)</p>
