<p>My last post on <a href="http://www.davesquared.net/2009/06/moving-to-scenario-based-unit-testing.html">Moving to scenario-based unit testing in .NET</a> was pretty long, even for me. I've just gone and done a rough conversion of it to PDF, so if you felt the topic was vaguely interesting but were put off by having to scroll through loads of my aesthetically-challenged blog screens, then feel free to give the PDF a go. I feel it would have really helped me had I read it a year or so ago, so I thought I'd put it in a more readable format to try and encourage someone else to actually read it. :)</p>

<p>Unfortunately the conversion process didn't improve the actual content of the post, so you'll still have to bear with my insufferable ramblings if you decide to subject yourself to it. ;)</p>
