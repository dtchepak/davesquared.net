<p>Just reading through ScottGu's <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/11/29/net-web-product-roadmap-asp-net-silverlight-iis7.aspx">.NET Web Product Roadmap</a> and noticed this (emphasis mine):</p> <blockquote> <p>"We will also shortly begin sharing details of a new web application deployment framework for IIS that enables you to <strong>easily automate the deployment of web applications</strong> on either a single server or across a web farm of machines.&nbsp; It will make it easy to <strong>version your web applications</strong> (including allowing you to quickly <strong>roll back to previous versions</strong>), as well as automatically provision them across multiple servers.&nbsp; It also enables the <strong>full automation of deployment tasks</strong> (including via both command-line and PowerShell scripting APIs)."</p></blockquote> <p>This sounds like much more fun that <a href="http://davesquared.blogspot.com/2007/08/example-of-deploying-web-apps-using.html">other</a> <a href="http://davesquared.blogspot.com/2007/08/example-of-deploying-web-apps-using-wix.html">approaches</a> I have tried.</p> <p>ScottGu also mentions that the first public preview of ASP.NET 3.5 Extensions (including ASP.NET MVC) will be released next week! Woohoo! More toys!&nbsp;:-)</p>
