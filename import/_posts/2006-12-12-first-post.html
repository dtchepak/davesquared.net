<p>Much to my own disgust I have started a blog. I have held out for as long as possible, but I really need a place to store any links I intend to come back to later. This blog is intended for an exclusive audience of one - me (well, three if you count myself and I).</p><p>I don't hold out high hopes for this venture, but giving it a try can't hurt. I hope.</p>
