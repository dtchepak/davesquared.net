<p>Jeremy Miller has a good summary of the <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2007/03/19/MVP-Summit-Recapped_3A00_-Linq-for-Entities_2C00_-MonoRail_2C00_-and-Shameless-Name-Dropping.aspx">general MVP impressions of Linq for Entities</a> after the recent MVP Summit. Everyone seems impressed by the potential of the product, but I was very interested to hear other OR Mappers, specifically NHibernate, being preferred at this stage.

Exciting times. :-)</p>
