<p>What will happen if the <code>&lt;authorization /&gt;</code> elements in a <code>web.config</code> conflict?</p>

<pre>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;configuration&gt;
 &lt;system.web&gt;
  &lt;authentication mode=&quot;Windows&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;authorization&gt;
      <b>&lt;allow users=&quot;*&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;deny users=&quot;*&quot; /&gt;</b>
    &lt;/authorization&gt;
 &lt;/system.web&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;</pre>

<p>Most people that know anything about ASP.NET will realise that the authorisation rules are evaluated in order (from <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8d82143t.aspx">MSDN</a>: &quot;<i>the authorization module finds the first access rule that fits a particular user account</i>&quot;), so in this case the <code>&lt;allow /&gt;</code> will be evaluated first and all users will get access. Unfortunately, I am not one of these gifted people, and have been blissfully ignorant of this fact despite working with ASP.NET since its release in 2002*.</p>

<p>Feel free to express your ridicule in the comments :)</p>

<p>In other news related to both web.config and my ignorance, I discovered when reading up on this at MSDN that you can use <code>&lt;allow users=&quot;./SomeLocalAccount&quot; /&gt;</code> to reference the current computer if you are using local machine accounts, which has come in handy for the stuff I am working on today.</p>

<p style="font-size: xx-small">* By way of excuse for the inexcusable, a lot of my ASP.NET work has relied on old-style NTFS permissions (long story), or very basic rules like deny ? and allow *, so I've never ended up thinking much about this. When pressed on the topic I thought the strongest condition might take precedence :-\</p>
