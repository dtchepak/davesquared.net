<p>Jason Gorman has an example of how&nbsp;reuse sometimes (typically?) works within enterprises and in some platforms:&nbsp;</p> <p><a href="http://parlezuml.com/blog/?postid=511">Enterprise-scale Reuse - An Illustrated Example - Agile Software Process Improvement</a> </p> <p>Cost of compliance is everything. Saving 10 minutes every time someone implements&nbsp;a data entry form is great. Causing an <strong>additional</strong> three weeks spent debugging a black box and complying with the requirements of the service or platform is significantly less great.</p>
