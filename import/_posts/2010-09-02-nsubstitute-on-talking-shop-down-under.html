<p><a href="http://nsubstitute.github.com/">NSubstitute</a> is the subject of <a href="http://www.talkingshopdownunder.com/2010/08/episode-26-nsubstitute.html">Talking Shop Down Under's latest episode</a>.</p>

<p>If you'd like to hear Readify Principal Consultant and MVP <a href="http://www.richard-banks.org/">Richard Banks</a> interview the brilliant and beardly <a href="http://twitter.com/guywithbeard">Anthony Egerton</a> (with occasional nonsensical comments from a <a href="http://twitter.com/davetchepak">raving lunatic</a>*) then <a href="http://www.talkingshopdownunder.com/2010/08/episode-26-nsubstitute.html">give it a listen</a>.</p>

<p>In case you're wondering, all the &quot;anonymous&quot; comments are just an inside joke that you pretty much had to be at <a href="http://sydney.ozalt.net/">Sydney ALT.NET</a> for the NSubstitute launch to get. Rest assured they are intended purely at my expense. :)</p>

<p>I should also point out that there is lots of talk about <a href="http://www.ayende.com/projects/rhino-mocks.aspx">Rhino Mocks</a> in the discussion, but a lot of the inspiration for NSubstitute should also be credited to <a href="http://moq.me/">Moq</a> for blazing a trail towards <a href="http://www.davesquared.net/2008/10/very-basics-of-aaa-with-rhino-mocks-35.html">Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA)</a> and getting rid of the distinction between mocks and stubs. Unfortunately we only talked about this after recording stopped, but it's important to acknowledge the awesomeness of both Rhino Mocks and Moq and the invaluable contributions they've made to .NET testing.</p>

<p>Even if you're not from Oz I'd really recommend the <a href="http://www.talkingshopdownunder.com/">Talking Shop Down Under podcast</a>. It's .NET focused, done in typically laid-back Aussie style, and takes a fairly quick (~30 min) run through whatever happens to be the topic of that week.</p>
