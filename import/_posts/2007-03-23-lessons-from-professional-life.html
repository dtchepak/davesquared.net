<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>Andres Taylor has a nice list of the <a href='http://www.taylor.se/reddit.html'>top ten things</a> he has learned from ten years of professional software development. He cited <a href='http://www.designobserver.com/archives/000121.html'>Michael McDonough's similar list</a> as his inspiration. Michael's list is based on his experience in traditional architecture and design, but it seems to apply to any creative field.</div>
