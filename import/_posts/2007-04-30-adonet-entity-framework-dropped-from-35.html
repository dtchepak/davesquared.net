<p>Microsoft has <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/adonet/archive/2007/04/28/ado-net-entity-framework-update.aspx">dropped the Entity Framework</a>, which includes LINQ for Entities, from the .NET 3.5 and VS.NET "Orcas" release.  The MSDN Data blog has an informative post on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/data/archive/2007/04/28/microsoft-s-data-access-strategy.aspx">Microsoft's Data Access Strategy</a>, which spells out the differences between the Entity Framework and LINQ to SQL.</p>

<p>Frans has a <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/fbouma/archive/2007/04/29/ado-net-entity-framework-cut-from-net-3-5-orcas.aspx">theory </a>on the motivation for this. I believe there was a lot of <a href="http://davesquared.blogspot.com/2007/03/linq-for-entities-mvp-impressions-from.html">constructive criticism at the 2007 MVP Summit</a> recently, and it seemed like the MS developers there were keen to address any issues the MVPs found. So maybe the reason is not just business-related as Frans' speculates? Maybe they just want to get it right first go, instead of the usual MS approach of waiting until version 3 SP1 ;-).</p>

<p>Anyway, shame it is dropped from Orcas, but maybe it will give other ORM tools like NHibernate a chance to get some nice LINQ integration going in the meantime.</p>
