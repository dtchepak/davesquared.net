<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>John Sheehan has some <a href='http://john-sheehan.com/blog/index.php/net-cheat-sheets/'>.NET Cheat Sheets</a> available. The page life-cycle summary is quite good. He also links to the really nice <a href='http://www.ilovejackdaniels.com/cheat-sheets/regular-expressions-cheat-sheet/'>Regular Expressions cheat sheet</a> by Dave Child. Both the cheat sheet and the accompanying notes are very handy.</div>
