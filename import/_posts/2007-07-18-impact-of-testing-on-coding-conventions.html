<p>Tim Ottinger has a nice post on how <a title="TDD changes your old coding conventions" href="http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2007/07/17/testing-will-challenge-your-conventions">TDD challenges your old coding conventions</a>. Some of the changes TDD encourage include:</p> <ul> <li>More interfaces  <li>Singletons/static methods considered harmful (or at least hard to test)  <li>Replacing private members with appropriate interfaces.  <li>More factories, less calls to concrete constructors  <li>Interface design by actual use (rather than anticipated use)  <li>Dependency avoidance.</li></ul> <p>To quote Tim:</p> <blockquote>For the most part, TDD forces you to start doing the things you always should have done.</blockquote>
