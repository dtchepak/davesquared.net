<p>I was looking through some VS 2008 options and found something that would have really helped me about 4 or so years ago:</p> 
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wEsHWMWy090/R1NGoaYnb5I/AAAAAAAAAew/Dcv3pJktmTY/s1600-R/DreamweaverSupportInVS2008.png"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wEsHWMWy090/R1NGoaYnb5I/AAAAAAAAAew/mzsLR5M6WbY/s400/DreamweaverSupportInVS2008.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5139529259851149202" /></a></p>
<p>Dreamweaver template (DWT) support :-) This, along with things like <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/11/13/asp-net-mvc-framework-part-1.aspx">test project template downloads for NUnit, MBUnit et al</a>&nbsp;(search for "NUnit" for relevant bits), makes me think Microsoft is starting to play nice, and that the <a href="http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2007/12/01/Microsoft-the-company-vs.-Microsoft-Employees.aspx">MS employees might be getting the upper hand</a>. :-)</p>
