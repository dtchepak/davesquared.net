<p>Jeffrey Palermo has blogged his thoughts on the new <a title="ASP.NET MVC framework" href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeffrey.palermo/archive/2007/10/05/altnetconf-scott-guthrie-announces-asp-net-mvc-framework-at-alt-net-conf.aspx">ASP.NET MVC framework</a> ScottGu is covering at the Alt.Net conference. This is the one <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2007/09/17/why-is-microsoft-removing-my-mvp-status.aspx">Phil Haack has signed up for</a>. Besides the overall niceness of MVC (and the option to skip some of the standard WebForm complexity), I love that it will have hooks to plug other offerings in, such as using MonoRail as the view engine instead of ASPX. </p> <p><strong>UPDATE 2007-10-15</strong>: ScottGu has posted his <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/10/14/asp-net-mvc-framework.aspx">summary of the MVC framework</a>, and is promising some tutorials exploring the framework in more depth over the coming weeks.</p>
