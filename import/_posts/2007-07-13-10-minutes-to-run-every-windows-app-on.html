<p>I have to try this:&nbsp;</p> <p><a href="http://venturecake.com/10-minutes-to-run-every-windows-app-seamlessly-on-your-ubuntu-desktop">VentureCake » Blog Archive » 10 minutes to run every Windows app on your Ubuntu desktop</a> </p> <p>It uses VMWare, SeamlessRDP, and rdesktop to run Windows apps from a virtual machine, and display them on your GNOME desktop.</p><p>VentureCake also has a helpful guide on running an existing Windows installation from Linux by setting up <a href="http://www.venturecake.com/a-simple-guide-to-using-your-existing-windows-install-apps-in-ubuntu/">VMWare to use Windows from the physical disk</a> (rather than a virtual image).
