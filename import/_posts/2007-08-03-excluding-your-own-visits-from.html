<p>It is easy to exclude your own visits to your Analytics-tracked site when you have a static IP -- you can just filter out all requests from there. It becomes a bit less straight forward when you have a dynamic IP, or&nbsp;on a large network&nbsp;that maps to a single public IP or IP block (say, at work). </p> <p><a title="It turns out" href="http://www.akamarketing.com/blog/40-google-analytics-excluding-your-visits-despite-having-a-dynamic-ip.html">It turns out</a> you can use some built-in Urchin functionality to set a cookie on your browser, which you can then use to filter out your own visits. <a href="http://www.google.com/support/analytics/bin/answer.py?answer=27207&amp;topic=2970">Google</a> also has some help with this, but the former link is much clearer and more complete.</p> <p>Because I did not want to setup a specific page to do this (as suggested in the article), I just use <a href="http://davesquared.blogspot.com/2007/04/my-favourite-firefox-add-ons.html">FireBug</a> to execute the following JavaScript in the context of my site, which will set a cookie that expires in 20 years or so:</p><pre>__utmSetVar("no_report");</pre>
<p>, where <code>"no_report"</code> is the pattern you are filtering by in Analytics. The process for defining a filter is outlined <a href="http://www.google.com/support/googleanalytics/bin/answer.py?answer=55492&hl=en">here</a>, and you need to configure it like this:</p>
<pre>Filter Type: Custom filter > Exclude
Filter Field: User Defined
Filter Pattern: <b>no_report</b>
Case Sensitive: No
</pre>
<p><b>Update 2008-02-04:</b> This post was originally published to work with the old Analytics tracking code. Since then Google Analytics introduced a new version of the tracking code. Instead of <code>__utmSetVar()</code>, the equivalent for the new code is <code>pageTracker._setVar('no_report');</code>. I ended up saving  <code>javascript:pageTracker._setVar('no_report');</code> as a bookmark.</p>
