<p>Just came across some great guidance from <a href="http://devlicio.us/blogs/casey/">Casey Charlton</a> on the <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/altdotnet/">ALT.NET mailing list</a>. My <a href="http://davesquared.blogspot.com/2008/06/attempting-to-understand-dependency.html">last post on dependency injection</a> mentioned the benefit of documenting class dependencies via the constructor used for DI. But what about cross cutting concerns like logging? From <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/altdotnet/message/10141">Casey's mailing list post</a>:</p>  <blockquote>&quot;Constructor properties shouldnt be used for cross cutting concerns like logging ... Put ILogger as a public property on the class, use the nulllogger as the default value, register the logging facility in Windsor, and all will magically happen&quot;  </blockquote>  <p>I like this -- unique dependencies in your constructor, others set via property-injection. I'm also pretty keen on the idea of AOP for doing a lot of basic logging, but I haven't had a good look at this in .NET yet. The <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/altdotnet/message/10109">ALT.NET thread</a> has a bit more of a discussion on logging.</p>
