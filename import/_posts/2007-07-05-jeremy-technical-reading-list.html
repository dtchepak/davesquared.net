<p>Jeremy Miller has posted the <a title="technical books that have most influence him" href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2007/07/04/the-books-that-influenced-me.aspx">technical books that have most influenced him</a>.&nbsp;I have read a heap of technical books, but to be honest most of the best stuff I find is online. </p> <p>I think the best technical book I have ever read is <a href="http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/cbook/">K &amp; R's "The C Programming Language"</a>&nbsp;-- it is&nbsp;succinct, nice to read and provides the reader with a great understanding of one of the most influential programming languages to ever grace a computer :)</p>
