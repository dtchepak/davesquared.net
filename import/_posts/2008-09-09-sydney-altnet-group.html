<p>Just wanted to quickly pass on the <a href="http://sydneyaltdotnet.blogspot.com/2008/08/welcome-to-sydney-altnet-group.html">announcement</a> that a <a href="http://sydneyaltdotnet.blogspot.com/">Sydney ALT.NET group</a> is starting up. <a href="http://sydneyaltdotnet.blogspot.com/2008/09/sydney-altnet-first-meeting-will-be.html">First meeting</a> is at the Thoughtworks office in the city on 30th September.</p>

<p>Hopefully this will do well -- I'd love a group in Sydney where we can focus on software development practices in .NET, with specific tools and technologies taking a bit of a back seat.</p>
