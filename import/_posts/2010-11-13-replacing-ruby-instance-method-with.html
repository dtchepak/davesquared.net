<p>I was recently playing around with replacing methods on specific Ruby instances. Everything is open for change in Ruby so I thought it would be a piece of cake. And in a way it was. The catch was that I wanted the method definition to close over some local variables I had declared (the same way <code>() =&gt; localVar;</code> will close over <code>localVar</code> for .NET lambdas), and this proved to be a little trickier than I expected.</p>

<h2>Basic instance method replacement</h2>

<p>Say we have an incredibly exciting <code>Greeter</code> class that says hello:</p>

<pre class="brush: ruby">
class Greeter
    def say_hello
        puts "Hello World!"
    end
end

greeter = Greeter.new
greeter.say_hello

#=&gt; Hello World!
</pre>

<p>We can easily re-define this method on a specific instance like this:</p>

<pre class="brush: ruby">
def greeter.say_hello
    puts "Howdy World!"
end
greeter.say_hello
#=&gt; Howdy World!
</pre>

<div class="note"><b>Note: </b> It is just as easy to redefine this method on all instances of <code>Greeter</code> by opening up the class as <a href="http://davesquared.net/2010/11/replacing-ruby-instance-method-with.html?showComment=1289659978198#c4877835427233880947">Derick points out in the comments</a>. In this case I just want to replace the method on the specific <code>greeter</code> instance, not on all instances of the <code>Greeter</code> class.</div>

<p>Now say that rather than hard-coding a greeting in our re-defined method, we want to reference a local variable instead (useful for replacing methods for unit tests).</p>

<pre class="brush: ruby">
name = "Anonymous Dave"
def greeter.say_hello
    puts "Hello #{name}"
end

#This won't work:
#  greeter.say_hello
#It gives this exception:
# in `say_hello': undefined local variable or method `name' for #&lt;Greeter:0x337e1e0&gt; (NameError)
</pre>

<p>This doesn't work because when we get to <code>def greeter.say_hello</code> we've changed the current scope to the <code>greeter</code> instance, and <code>greeter</code> knows nothing about <code>name</code>; it does not exist in the scope <code>say_hello</code> is running in. What we really want is to capture the <code>name</code> variable via a closure when we define the method, and in Ruby, we can do this with blocks and Procs.</p>

<h2>A detour into Ruby internals and other stuff I don't understand</h2>
<p>I'm completely out of my depth here, but here is my Ruby n00bie interpretation of some Ruby mumbo jumbo. First, everything in Ruby is an object, and every object has a class (as near as I can tell). Even <code>nil</code> (Ruby's <code>null</code>):</p>

<pre class="brush: ruby">
puts nil.class
#=&gt; NilClass
puts nil.methods.count
#=&gt; 71
</pre>

<p>If you're from a .NET background, we've just called <code>null.GetType().GetMethods().Length</code> and lived to tell the tale (and been told 71 apparently :)).</p>

<p>Anyway, the point is that everything is an object and they all have classes. Our <code>greeter</code> object is an instance of the <code>Greeter</code> class we defined earlier. Ruby has all kinds of interesting ways of interacting with instances and classes, including <code>instance_eval</code> and <code>class_eval</code> which let us run code within the context, or scope, of both instances and classes. Unfortunately none of these seem to work the scope in a way that will let us add an instance method to a specific instance using a closure (please let me know if I'm wrong).</p>

<p>There is another option: Ruby <i>metaclasses</i> (a.k.a. <i>eigenclasses</i>). It turns out that when I said that <code>greeter</code>'s class is <code>Greeter</code>, I sort of lied. In fact, Ruby itself will dissemble slightly when you run <code>greeter.class</code> and it says <code>Greeter</code>. Every object has a class, but also a <i>metaclass</i>. And a <i>metaclass'</i> class has <i>Class</i>, as well as it's own <i>metaclass</i>, which I guess is a <i>meta-metaclass</i>. And so on into madness.</p>

<p>In a valiant attempt to get back on topic, the idea is that you can add a method to a <i>metaclass</i> that will only be available on the instance. If you modify a method on the <i>class</i> then it will appear on all instances.</p>

<p>The next thing we need to know is that everything that inherits from <code>Class</code> has a very useful method called <code>define_method</code> which defines a method from a block. Unfortunately this method is private. But luckily you can invoke private methods in Ruby using the <code>send</code> method. The send method is also cursed and contains potassium benzoate... kidding.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, we can now solve the original problem.</p>

<h2>Instance method replacement with closures</h2>

<p>So what we need to do is get access to the <code>greeter</code> instance metaclass, and <code>send</code> a <code>define_method</code> call with a block that closes over our local variable. We can access an instance's metaclass by using the <i>class &lt;&lt; instance</i> syntax, which will change the current scope to <code>instance</code>'s metaclass (so <code>self</code> will refer to the metaclass. This is confusing; see <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2009/11/15/metaprogramming-in-ruby-its-all-about-the-self/">Yehuda's article</a> for a great explanation). And the rest is fairly straight forward:</p>

<pre class="brush: ruby">
greeters_metaclass = class &lt;&lt; greeter; self; end
greeters_metaclass.send(:define_method, :say_hello) do
    puts "G'day #{name}"
end
greeter.say_hello
#=&gt; G'day Anonymous Dave

name = "closure"
greeter.say_hello
#=&gt; G'day closure
</pre>

<p>We now have all the pieces put together. We've got our paws on a reference to the instance's metaclass, and we've defined a class using a block (<code>do..end</code>) which will close over our local variable using the metaclass' private <code>define_method</code> via <code>send</code>. Piece of cake, right? :)</p>

<h2>Parting thoughts</h2>
<p>This tripped me up for a while, and this post is my attempt to try and decipher what is happening. It's not quite as bad as I make it sound, it just requires some understanding about Ruby's class system and closures. Along the way I found these absolutely essential references that will hopefully clear things up a bit for you:</p>
