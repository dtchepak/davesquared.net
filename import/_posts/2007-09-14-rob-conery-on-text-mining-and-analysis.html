<p>Rob has posted <a title="part 1 of a series on mining unstructured data" href="http://blog.wekeroad.com/2007/09/12/text-mining-and-analysis-with-linqtosql-part-1/">part 1 of a series on mining unstructured data</a>. He goes through some basics on ETL (Extraction, Transformation, Loading) and natural language parsing, implements a text miner using LinqToSql, and analyses the results. For the next part we are promised some data warehousing tricks, more analysis techniques, and some OLAP with Excel.&nbsp;It has been an interesting read for me as I am pretty unfamiliar with this area of IT. </p>
