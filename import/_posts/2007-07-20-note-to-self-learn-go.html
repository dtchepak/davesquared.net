<p>I always pretty&nbsp;keen on self improvement. Mladen wrote that part of&nbsp;<a href="http://weblogs.sqlteam.com/mladenp/archive/2007/07/18/60259.aspx">his efforts to become a better developer</a> would&nbsp;include playing more chess. In one of the <a href="http://weblogs.sqlteam.com/mladenp/archive/2007/07/18/60259.aspx#36802">comments</a>, Lee Richardson suggested trying <a title="Go" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28board_game%29">Go</a> instead. Under the heading of "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28board_game%29#Cognitive_benefits">Cognitive benefits</a>", the&nbsp;Wikipedia article&nbsp;on Go&nbsp;suggests:</p> <blockquote> <p>The game purportedly increases usage of both hemispheres of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain">brain</a>, in contrast to other games (such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess">Chess</a>), which are primarily "right or left brain" games, and it also may reinforce the neurological connection between the hemispheres. This multi-dimensional play is supposedly the result of the combining of pure numerical calculation and an intuitive spatial awareness.</p></blockquote> <p>I like little mental exercises (sudoku, logic puzzles, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi">Reversi/Othello</a>, programming :)). Especially ones I can do (chess not really falling into this category, arguably not programming either ;)).&nbsp;So I'm going to see how I go with&nbsp;<a title="Go" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28board_game%29">Go</a>.&nbsp;:)</p>
