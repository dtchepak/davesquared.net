<p><a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/">AutoHotkey</a> is a free, GPL'd project for "automating almost anything by sending keystrokes and mouse clicks". It has a very flexible scripting language that allows you to map combinations of keys and clicks to arbitrarily complex commands.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.enovatic.org/products/niftywindows/features/">NiftyWindows</a> is a very nice pre-done script for AutoHotkey that provides mouse-shortcuts for common window operations like move, resize, Alt-TAB switching etc.</p>

<p><b>[Added 2008-04-21]</b> <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/scripts/EasyWindowDrag.htm">Easy Window Drag sample</a> lets you easily drag windows around without having to hunt for the title bar. I slightly modified the script to let me ALT + Left mouse drag windows around, Linux-style :).</p>
