<P><a href="http://www.hibernate.org/343.html">NHibernate</a> is a .NET port of Hibernate for Java. From the website:</p>
<blockquote>"[NHibernate] handles persisting plain .NET objects to and from an underlying relational database."
</blockquote> <p>NHibernate has close ties to the well known and well documented <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/">Hibernate </a>project, so there is lots of <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/5.html">information </a>available. This is on the must-try list, as soon as I get a spare second and a half at work. </p> <p>Other O/R mappers include <a href="http://www.llblgen.com/">LLBLGen Pro</a> and <a href="http://www.ormapper.net/">WilsonORMapper</a>.</p>
