Scott Allen has an excellent article on <a href="http://www.odetocode.com/Articles/473.aspx">What ASP.NET Developers Should Know About JavaScript</a>. He covers JSON and Object Oriented JavaScript programming. Over the past year or some my opinion of JavaScript has dramatically improved. I never thought I'd see the day when I actually <a href="http://davesquared.blogspot.com/2007/07/test-driving-javascript-code.html">enjoyed using JavaScript</a> :). If you are still harbouring old war-wounds and grievances against the language, make sure you take a look at Scott's and others' relevant articles, then give it another go.
