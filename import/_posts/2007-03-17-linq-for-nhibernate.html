<a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2007/03/16/Linq-for-NHibernate.aspx">Jeremy Miller</a> has pointed out there is work afoot to use <a href="http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2007/03/16/Linq-for-NHibernate.aspx">Linq as a front-end for NHibernate</a>. ScottGu <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/03/13/new-orcas-language-feature-extension-methods.aspx">mentioned earlier</a> that Linq was designed for this kind of interoperability (point #3 under the heading "Built-in System.Linq Extension Methods" which specifically mentions NHibernate et al). It's nice to see this kind of approach from MS becoming more prevalent.
