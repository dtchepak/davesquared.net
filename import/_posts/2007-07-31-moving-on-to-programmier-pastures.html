<p>I am leaving my current place of employment as part of my constant effort to <a href="http://davesquared.blogspot.com/2007/07/becoming-better-developer.html">become a better developer</a>. Part of <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2007/07/08/what-i-ve-already-done-to-be-a-better-developer.aspx">Jeremy's tips</a> on becoming a better developer include talking to and learning from (and with) other like-minded developers, which my current role just cannot offer. </p> <p>My role was increasingly moving away from development (see screenshot below) and focusing more&nbsp;on higher-level aspects of technology, such as planning MOSS deployment and standards for zero-code MOSS-based&nbsp;applications.&nbsp;My new role is more development focused, and the people I have met in the team seem to share a lot of my goals in terms of improving development techniques and <a href="http://davesquared.blogspot.com/2007/06/explaining-good-code-to-non-geeks.html">investing in good code</a>.</p> <p><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="/images/fromblogger/s1600-h-whyImLeaving.png"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5093186497943449074" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; cursor: hand; text-align: center" alt="" src="/images/fromblogger/s400-whyImLeaving.png" border="0"></a></p> <p>I have been with my current employer for over 5 years, during which time I have gained two wonderful daughters and lost my wonderful Mum to cancer, so it has been a constant through both joyous and devastating times. I have also worked with some great people (I have to say that, two of them make up 100% of my blog audience after forcing them to subscribe&nbsp;;-) Hi gents!). I definitely would not have stayed for this long&nbsp;if it were not for the&nbsp;fantastic personalities I have worked with (including the "brotherhood of the chilli-drenched doner kebabs", to paraphrase a line in Jeremy's post). I have definitely learned a lot here, including a lot of self-taught technical stuff, but also on the non-technical side of things from my manager and colleagues.&nbsp;</p> <p>As much as I'll miss the people, the fast laptop and the 22" wide screen display, I am really looking forward to more code and&nbsp;more developer peers. I start in early August.</p> <p>So once I start contributing to an OSS project&nbsp;or three then I'll have&nbsp;covered all 6 of Jeremy's&nbsp;points. I wonder if he offers a guarantee&nbsp;with his "steps to success" program? :-)</p>
