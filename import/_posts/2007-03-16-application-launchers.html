<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">UPDATE May 2007</span><span style="font-style: italic;">: </span><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://davesquared.blogspot.com/2007/05/launchy-application-launcher.html">Colibri has been supplanted by Launchy</a><span style="font-style: italic;"> on my desktop since this post.</span></p>

<p>I stumbled across a very nice application launcher for Windows, <a href="http://colibri.leetspeak.org/">Colibri - Type Ahead.</a> Pressing CTRL-SPACE activates the Colibri search input. You then start typing and it displays applications that match. For example, "not" displays notepad and other apps with "not" in the title. I never need the Start menu again!</p>

<p>Another nice feature is the integration with Google. Press CTRL-SPACE, type "Goo", press tab and enter your search term. You default browser then opens to display the results of the Google-search.</p>

<p>There are similar launchers available for Linux: the <a href="http://raphael.slinckx.net/deskbar/">GNOME Deskbar</a> applet (which sits in your panel), <a href="http://katapult.kde.org/">Katapult</a> for KDE and <a href="http://developer.imendio.com/projects/gnome-launch-box">GNOME Launch Box</a>. The Deskbar applet has loads of features, but because it sits in the panel it does not seem quite as integrated and instinctive to use as the others (read: not eye candy :-)). Katapult and the GNOME Launch Box are both quite awesome, but in reasonably early stages of development.</p>

<p>I've got no idea what you could use on a <a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">Mac</a> ;-)
