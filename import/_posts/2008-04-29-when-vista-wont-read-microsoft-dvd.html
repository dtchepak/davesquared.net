<p style="font-size: small"><i><b>WARNING:</b> <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/inconsequential">Fluff piece</a> ahead!</i></p>

<p>I recently attended the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/australia/heroes/">Microsoft Heroes Happen {2008}</a> launch event for VS 2008, Windows 2008 and SQL Server 2008 in Sydney. All attendees received a &quot;launch pack&quot; of Microsoft software, which included a promotional, 90-day trial of Visual Studio 2008 Team System.</p>

<p>I chucked the DVD in the drive of my home PC and Vista asked me what I wanted to do with the <em>blank disc</em>.</p>

<p>Great, so I managed to get a faulty disc, right? Well, on a whim I fired up my <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu 8.04</a> VM and tried reading the disc:</p>

<p>So to install my promotional Microsoft software on Microsoft Vista I had to rely on Linux. :-) Turns out it was just a driver issue with Vista from either a recent update or software installation, fixed by removing and replacing the DVD device in Device Manager, but I still found it mildly amusing. While not qualifying as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony">ironic</a>, it probably meets the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony#Usage_controversy">Alanis-definition</a> :-)</p>
