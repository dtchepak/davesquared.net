I have started to use <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> on this site. Part of the <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/en-GB/tos.html">Terms of Use</a> is to include a privacy policy with adequate information on the use of Analytics for the site. So here is my privacy policy, which is quoted directly from Section 8.1 of the <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/en-GB/tos.html">Terms of Use</a>. I'll update this post if there are any changes.
