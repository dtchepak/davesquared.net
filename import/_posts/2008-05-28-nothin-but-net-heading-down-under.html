<p>I left a <a href="http://www.jpboodhoo.com/blog/CommentView,guid,4862047e-58c7-4041-93b5-242631c675cc.aspx#commentstart">comment on JP Boodhoo's blog</a> recently, and asked if there was any chance of him running a <a href="http://www.jpboodhoo.com/training/courseschedule.aspx">Nothin' But .NET</a> course in Sydney, Australia. I got an email response from him a short time later:</p>

<blockquote>"As far as the course in Australia!! I will be there next year [2009] to give a course in Sydney!!"</blockquote>

<p>I've been really keen to attend this course for ages now, but the commute to Canada each day was pushing it a bit :). In case you don't know what the course is all about, here's a <a href="http://kyle.baley.org/NothinButNETOrHowToJustifyIgnoringYourHomeLife.aspx">review (and links to other reviews) from Kyle Bailey's old blog</a>. To quote a bit of the blurb from a <a href="http://www.acteva.com/booking.cfm?bevaid=150218">recently scheduled course</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
Nothin’ But .Net is a five day boot camp that will focus on pragmatically applying .Net within the context of developing a working N-Tiered application. Registrants will learn about advanced features of .Net (2.0/3.0/3.5) as they are applied to the task of building a complete application from the UI layer all the way down to the mapping layer.

<p>It sounds awesome. Hope to see a few like-minded Aussie developers there! In the mean time, if anyone knows of any current course in Sydney that covers any of this stuff please leave a comment or email me, as I'd try and attend that too during the looonnnggg wait 'til JP visits in 2009.</p>
