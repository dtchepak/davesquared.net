<p>Jeremy Miller's post on "<a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2007/07/08/what-i-ve-already-done-to-be-a-better-developer.aspx">What I've already done to be a better developer</a>" really jibes with my own thoughts on the topic. I've got the blog and the reading parts down well, now I just need to work on the others :-)</p><p><i>Update:</i> Udi posted a somewhat-related post on <a href="http://udidahan.weblogs.us/2007/07/19/6-simple-steps-to-becoming-a-top-it-consultant/">becoming a top consultant</a>. Both Jeremy's and Udi's posts have a common thread of interactions with other developers being extremely important, such as through work, user groups, blogging, OSS etc.</p>
