<p>Tonight at Sydney ALT.NET <a href="http://twitter.com/guywithbeard">Anthony Egerton</a> announced <a href="http://nsubstitute.github.com">NSubstitute</a>, his mocking framework for .NET 3.5+. I've been contributing some code to NSubstitute and I like to blog, so I thought I'd take it upon myself to do the written version of the announcement. :)</p>

<p>This all started a few months ago during some pair programming where we started discussing how we would ideally like our mocking code to read. Anthony came up with some neat syntax ideas and we decided to start working on it as a hobby project in our spare time, the aim being to play around with a simple, succinct syntax for mocking, as well as to try out some different testing techiques and to learn a bit about DynamicProxy.</p> 

<p>We liked the syntax so much we've started using it on work projects, and so we thought we'd <a href="http://github.com/nsubstitute/NSubstitute">put it out there</a> in case anyone else was interested or has some ideas on how to improve it. It's still a little rough around the edges (the exception message formatting needs lots of work, and it doesn't support Mono or Silverlight yet), but it's pretty usable in its current state and should be enough to give people an idea of what we're aiming for.</p>

<h2>NSubstitute examples</h2>

<p>Say we have an <code>ICalculator</code> interface:</p>

<pre class="brush:csharp">
public interface ICalculator {
  int Add(int a, int b);
  string Mode { get; set; }
  event Action PoweringUp;
}
</pre>

<p>We can ask NSubstitute to create a substitute instance for this type. We could ask for a stub, mock, fake, spy, test double etc., but why bother when we just want to substitute an instance we have some control over?</p>

<pre class="brush:csharp">
var calculator = Substitute.For&lt;ICalculator&gt;();
</pre>

<p>
 Now we can tell our substitute to return a value for a call:
</p>

<pre class="brush:csharp">
calculator.Add(1, 2).Returns(3);
Assert.That(calculator.Add(1, 2), Is.EqualTo(3));
</pre>

<p>
We can check that our substitute received a call, and did not receive others:
</p>

<pre class="brush:csharp">
calculator.Add(1, 2);
calculator.Received().Add(1, 2);     
calculator.DidNotReceive().Add(5, 7);
</pre>

<p>If our <code>Received()</code> assertion fails, NSubstitute tries to give us some help as to what the problem might be:</p>

<pre>
NSubstitute.Exceptions.CallNotReceivedException : Expected to receive call:
    Add(1, 2)
Actually received:
    Add(4, 5)
    Add(3, 4)
</pre>

<p>We can also work with properties using the <code>Returns</code> syntax we use for methods, or just stick with plain old property setters (for read/write properties):</p>

<pre class="brush:csharp">
calculator.Mode.Returns("DEC");
Assert.That(calculator.Mode, Is.EqualTo("DEC"));

calculator.Mode = "HEX";
Assert.That(calculator.Mode, Is.EqualTo("HEX"));
</pre>

<p>NSubstitute supports argument matching for setting return values and asserting a call was received:</p>

<pre class="brush:csharp">
calculator.Add(10, -5);
calculator.Received().Add(10, Arg.Any&lt;int&gt;());
calculator.Received().Add(10, Arg.Is&lt;int&gt;(x =&gt; x &lt; 0));
</pre>

<p>We can use argument matching as well as passing a function to <code>Returns()</code> to get some more behaviour out of our substitute (possibly too much, but that's your call):</p>

<pre class="brush:csharp">
calculator
  .Add(Arg.Any&lt;int&gt;(), Arg.Any&lt;int&gt;())
  .Returns(x =&gt; (int)x[0] + (int)x[1]);
Assert.That(calculator.Add(5, 10), Is.EqualTo(15));
</pre>

<p><code>Returns()</code> can also be called with multiple arguments to set up a sequence of return values.</p>

<pre class="brush:csharp">
calculator.Mode.Returns("HEX", "DEC", "BIN");
Assert.That(calculator.Mode, Is.EqualTo("HEX")); 
Assert.That(calculator.Mode, Is.EqualTo("DEC")); 
Assert.That(calculator.Mode, Is.EqualTo("BIN")); 
</pre>

<p>Finally, we can raise events on our substitutes (unfortunately C# dramatically restricts the extent to which this syntax can be cleaned up):</p>

<pre class="brush:csharp">
bool eventWasRaised = false;
calculator.PoweringUp += () =&gt; eventWasRaised = true;

calculator.PoweringUp += Raise.Action();
Assert.That(eventWasRaised);
</pre>

<h2>How can I try this out?</h2>
<p>Easy, just head on over to <a href="http://nsubstitute.github.com">nsubstitute.github.com</a> and download the binary. Then add the <code>NSubstitute.dll</code> as a project reference, add <code>using NSubstitute;</code> to your CS file and start substituting. Or grab the source from the <a href="http://github.com/nsubstitute/NSubstitute">project site on GitHub</a> and start tinkering.</p>

<p>If you try it out I'd love to hear how you go!</p>

<h2>Some quick acknowledgements</h2>
<p>It doesn't seem right to plug this and not give kudos to some of the people that made it possible, both directly and indirectly.</p>

<p>First, <a href="http://twitter.com/guywithbeard">Anthony</a> deserves the credit for the awesome syntax ideas in NSub. I take full credit for all the implementation bugs, as well as for some of the ridiculous abstractions in the code (including a really dodgy, mini-IoC container for wiring up routes and handlers. Yuck. :)). <a href="http://troyhunt.com">Troy Hunt</a> did a great job of knocking out a logo for us. <a href="http://twitter.com/xerxesb">Xerxes</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/shannoncornish">Shannon</a> also helped out with some code and suggestions respectively. <a href="http://kozmic.pl/">Krzysztof</a> also provided some much needed help over email and twitter on how to dynamically create delegates using .NET 3.5 expressions.</p>

<p>There are also a few people and projects that NSubstitute owes its existence to. <a href="http://ayende.com">Ayende</a> and the awesome <a href="http://ayende.com/projects/rhino-mocks.aspx">Rhino Mocks</a> project really started us mocking in the first place, and did a great job making mocking viable on the .NET platform. Also thanks to <a href="http://www.clariusconsulting.net/blogs/kzu/">Daniel Cazzulino</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/moq/">moq</a> for bringing Arrange Act Assert-style mocking  to .NET (to the world?). NSubstitute relies entirely on <a href="http://davesquared.net/2008/10/very-basics-of-aaa-with-rhino-mocks-35.html">AAA mocking</a> for its syntax, intentionally providing no support for strict mocks or record/replay. And finally to <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/">Castle Project's DynamicProxy</a> which we rely on (like almost everyone else) to generate our proxies.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Happy substituting! :)</p>
