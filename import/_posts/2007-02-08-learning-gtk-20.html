<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>I have started working through the <a href='http://gtk.org/tutorial/'>GTK+ 2.0 Tutorial</a>, with the aim of being able to make a contribution to something like the <a href='http://www.gnome.org/projects/rhythmbox/'>Rhythmbox </a>project. So far I can display "Hello, World", which probably won't help out the Rhythmbox folks too much :).</div>
