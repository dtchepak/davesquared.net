<p>Found&nbsp;a number of useful articles on <a title="Dustin's site" href="http://www.dustindiaz.com/">Dustin's site</a>, which is dedicated to web usability and accessibility. Dustin works for Google (and previously for Yahoo!) and is a published author on the subject, so he is probably worth a read. :)</p> <p>An older article of his shows a nice&nbsp;implementation of the <a href="http://www.dustindiaz.com/top-ten-javascript">dollar function</a> <code>$()</code>, which is typically used in many libraries (including the ASP.NET AJAX client libraries) as a shortcut for <code>document.getElementById()</code>. Dustin's implementation handles multiple arguments, and can accept string IDs and object references.</p>
