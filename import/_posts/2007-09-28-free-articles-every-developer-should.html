<p>There are lots of great articles available from <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/publishedArticles.html">Object Mentor</a>. Here is a selection that I feel&nbsp;are essential for any developer. <em>Caution: ahead there be PDF links!</em></p> 
<p>First up, the "SOLID" design principles:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/srp.pdf">SRP — The Single Responsibility Principle</a>&nbsp;[PDF] <li><a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/ocp.pdf">OCP — The Open Closed Principle</a>&nbsp;[PDF] <li><a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/lsp.pdf">LSP — The Liskov Substitution Principle</a>&nbsp;[PDF]</li> <li><a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/isp.pdf">ISP — The Interface Segregation Principle</a>&nbsp;[PDF]</li> <li><a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/dip.pdf">DIP — The Dependency Inversion Principle</a>&nbsp;[PDF] </li>
</ul>
<p>Then some general practices and patterns:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/CoffeeMaker.pdf">Object Oriented Design Heuristics and Coffee</a>&nbsp;-- Robert C. Martin's Coffee Maker example [PDF]</li> <li><a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/xpepisode.htm">The Bowling Game: An example of test-first pair programming</a>&nbsp;-- Robert C. Marin and Robert S. Koss</li> <li><a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/TheHumbleDialogBox.pdf">The Humble Dialog Box</a>&nbsp;-- Michael Feathers' classic article on MVC and testing GUIs [PDF]</li> <li><a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/WorkingEffectivelyWithLegacyCode.pdf">Working Effectively with Legacy Code</a>&nbsp;-- Michael Feathers on testing&nbsp;existing code&nbsp;[PDF]</li></ul> <p>At the very least I would read <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/srp.pdf">SRP</a>, <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/ocp.pdf">OCP</a> and <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/CoffeeMaker.pdf">Coffee Maker</a> if you go anywhere remotely close to Object Oriented Design in your work. Closely followed by <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/TheHumbleDialogBox.pdf">The Humble Dialog Box</a> for information on the MVC design pattern, and <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/xpepisode.htm">The Bowling Game</a> to get an idea of what TDD is all about.</p>
