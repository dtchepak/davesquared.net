<p>Had to bookmark this older post from ScottGu:&nbsp;</p> <p><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2006/10/22/Tip_2F00_Trick_3A00_-Cool-UI-Templating-Technique-to-use-with-ASP.NET-AJAX-for-non_2D00_UpdatePanel-scenarios.aspx">Tip/Trick: Cool UI Templating Technique to use with ASP.NET AJAX for non-UpdatePanel scenarios - ScottGu's Blog</a> </p> <p>Scott first runs through letting the AJAX ScriptManager control generate JavaScript proxies for accessing server side code asynchronously.
