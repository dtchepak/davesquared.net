<p>Thanks to everyone that came along to my presentation on <a href="http://sydney.ozalt.net/2010/09/september-tdd-and-ooo-over-enthusiastic.html">TDD and Over-enthustiastic OO</a> at <a href="http://sydney.ozalt.net/">Sydney ALT.NET </a> this week. As promised, here's links to the code and some additional info.</p>

<p>If you'd like to contact me with questions or to give feedback please leave a comment or email &quot;me at davesquared.net&quot;.</p>

<h2>Code</h2>
<p>If you'd like to look through the code we drove out, it's up on <a href="http://github.com/dtchepak/DaveSquared.StringsTheThing">github</a>. I've also got a branch called <a href="http://github.com/dtchepak/DaveSquared.StringsTheThing/commits/checkpoints">checkpoints</a>, which has each step of the process checked in as the last 6 commits (done prior to the presentation).</p>

<h2>More information on TDD and OOO</h2>
<p>I originally posted the String Calculator example in October 2009. It's pretty much the same steps we went through during the presentation, but with a little more explanation about the steps.</p>

<li><a href="http://www.davesquared.net/2009/10/calculators-and-tale-of-two-tdds-pt-2.html">Part 2: First steps OOO-style</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.davesquared.net/2009/10/calculators-and-tale-of-two-tdds-pt-3.html">Part 3: Finishing the OOO example</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I've also got a couple of posts on some of the concepts we discussed:</p>

<li>And finally, for those of us that are a little too taken with TDD (cough): <a href="http://www.davesquared.net/2010/02/improving-tdd-skills-via-treatment-of.html">Improving TDD skills via treatment of test infection</a></li>

<h3>Screencasts</h3>
Turns out I was wrong, Richard did the Prime Factors kata, not String Calculator. Still, there are <a href="http://katas.softwarecraftsmanship.org/?s=string+calculator&x=0&y=0">lots of screencasts </a> on it in loads of different languages. I really recommend watching <a href="http://katas.softwarecraftsmanship.org/?p=128">Gary's version done in Python and Vim</a>; it's incredible!
