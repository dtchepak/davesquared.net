<p>After having the great pleasure of using <a href="http://davesquared.net/2007/03/application-launchers.html">Colibri Type Ahead for a few months</a>, it is with mixed feelings that I have uninstalled it. Sad, because it was a very nice app, but joyfully happy because I have found an even better replacement, <a href="http://www.launchy.net/index.html">Launchy</a> (thanks <a href="http://www.jpboodhoo.com/blog/IForgotMyMouseTodaybigDeal.aspx">JP</a>)!</p>

<p>It seems to do everything Colibri does but has the added advantage of being actively maintained, whereas Colibri has not been updated since my initial download (and the community page still says "relaunching soon"). Launchy definitely seems easier to customise, and has skin and plugin frameworks.</p>
