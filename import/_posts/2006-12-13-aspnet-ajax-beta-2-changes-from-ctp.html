<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A <a href="http://ajax.asp.net/files/AspNet_AJAX_CTP_to_Beta_Whitepaper.aspx">overview of the changes</a> between ASP.NET AJAX ("Atlas") CTP and Beta 2 (and ultimately RTM) has been posted. Of particular interest are the changes to the UpdatePanel control and to the client API, and significant bug fixes like validators now working properly. Of academic interest is the change from <a href="http://ajax.asp.net/files/AspNet_AJAX_CTP_to_Beta_Whitepaper.aspx#link7">closures to prototypes</a> for objects defined in the client libraries.
