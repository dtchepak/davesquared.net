<p>I can't believe <a title="this issue" href="http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=105123">this issue</a> is marked as Closed (fixed).&nbsp;The bug causes <a title="two requests to be made from when clicking an ImageButton in a CommandField" href="http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=105123">two requests to be made from when clicking an ImageButton in a CommandField</a>, which can do nasty things if you are deleting rows. Apparently the "fix" is to not use&nbsp;ImageButtons&nbsp;in CommandFields.&nbsp;Brilliant. Granted it is fairly straight forward to do with a TemplateField, but that is hardly fixing the original problem.</p> <p>If you are really keen on sticking to CommandFields you can do something terribly hacky like this:</p><pre>&lt;asp:CommandField CausesValidation="false" 
  DeleteText="&amp;lt;img border='0' src='Images/icon-delete-12x12.png' /&amp;gt;"
  ShowDeleteButton="true" ButtonType="Link" /&gt;
</pre>
