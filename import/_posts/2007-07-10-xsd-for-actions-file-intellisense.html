<p>John Holliday has a nice article on <a href="http://www.johnholliday.net/archive/2007/03/27/Add-Your-Own-Custom-Workflow-Activities-to-SharePoint-Designer-2007.aspx">Custom Workflow Activities to SharePoint Designer 2007</a>, which also includes a link to a WSSACTIONS.xsd file that enables Intellisense for .ACTIONS files in VS 2005. John's example is writing the value of a parameter to the event log.</p>
