<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/default.mspx">Sysinternals</a> (acquired by Microsoft in July 2006) have lots of useful tools for examining how applications are interacting with the Windows OS.</p> <p>A good example is the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/utilities/ProcessExplorer.mspx">Process Explorer</a>, which shows handles, DLLS and mapped files for all active processes. This is great for finding which process is locking that file that refuses to be deleted. </p>
