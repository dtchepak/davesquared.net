<p>The March 2007 edition of MSDN magazine has a nice article on the new features of <a href='http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/07/03/IIS7/'>IIS 7.0</a>.
I love and applaud this:</p>
<blockquote>The centralized configuration store of the previous IIS releases, known affectionately as the metabase, is gone. IIS 7.0 features a new delegated configuration system based on a hierarchy of distributed XML configuration files.</blockquote>
<p>But I cannot help but think <code>.htaccess</code>, and wonder what took them so long :-)</p>
