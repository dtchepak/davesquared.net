<p>I can't believe I am advocating a Microsoft product :) But to give credit where it is due, <a href="http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/">Windows Live Writer</a> is awesome. It offers varying levels of support for a number of blog types, including nice integration with SharePoint 2007.</p><p>I have had problems with the Blogger web editor mangling code samples and so forth, so Live Writer is a very welcomed change. There are a number of plug-ins available (and an SDK) to extend it, and MS even offers a FireFox plug-in (<a href="http://gallery.live.com/liveItemDetail.aspx?li=8eb2551a-49c1-45f9-b291-9b75241793a6&amp;l=8">Blog This for FireFox</a>) to replace my Performancing/ScribeFire plug-in.</p><p>I can now assault both the Sharepoint 2007 team blog at work and the Internet at large through this blog using the one interface!</p><p>Now to see if I can run it at home on Linux... :-)</p><p>PS: This post was obviously written and published with Live Writer.</p>
