<p>This page is an index page for the Garden Race series. This intention behind this series of posts is to teach myself a bit about the basics TDD and iterative development by working through an example of building a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakes_and_ladders">Snakes and Ladders</a>-style game. Hopefully this example strikes a balance between being simple enough to write up as blog posts and being involved enough to for me to learn some things about iterative development that can translate to real work.</p>
