<p>Anders has a <a title="fantastic post about creating DSLs using C#" href="http://andersnoras.com/blogs/anoras/archive/2007/07/09/behind-the-scenes-of-the-planning-dsl.aspx">fantastic post about creating DSLs&nbsp;using C#</a>. He covers the normal design rules you need to break when&nbsp;programming your DSL (like changing state in the get{} accessor), as well as other tips on building the grammar such as selectively overriding the implicit cast operator. A great read for anyone even remotely interested in <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/FluentInterface.html">fluent interfaces</a>.</p>
