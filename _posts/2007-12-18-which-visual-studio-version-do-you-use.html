<p>6 or earlier? My condolences. :-) 2002, 2003? Up-to-date with VS 2005? Or even cutting edge and have Visual Studio 2008 via MSDN subscriber downloads?</p>  <p>That's nothing, try <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sandcastle/archive/2007/12/18/we-are-hiring-how-far-can-your-potential-take-you.aspx">Visual Studio 2010, currently code-named &quot;Dev10&quot;</a>.</p>  <p>That's what <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sandcastle/archive/2007/12/18/we-are-hiring-how-far-can-your-potential-take-you.aspx">Anand</a> from the Sandcastle team is talkin' 'bout:</p>  <blockquote>We have also recently entered the active planning phase for Visual Studio 2010 (code named &#8220;Dev10&#8221;), the next wave of release for our key products and technologies.</blockquote>  <p>Good to know that despite using VS 2008 from the first day it was available, I am still behind the times :-)</p>
