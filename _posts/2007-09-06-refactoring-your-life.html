The Zenhabits blog has <a title="72 Ideas to Simplify Your Life" href="http://zenhabits.net/2007/09/simple-living-manifesto-72-ideas-to-simplify-your-life/">72 ideas to simplify your life</a>&nbsp;that are at least worth a skim and at best a good starting point for refactoring your life to a simpler, happier existence :). </p> <p>I've always found&nbsp;the parallels between some software practices&nbsp;and life slightly amusing.
