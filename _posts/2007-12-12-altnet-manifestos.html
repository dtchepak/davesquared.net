<p>I have been following the <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/altnetconf/messages">ALT.NET group</a> for a while now. The tech talk is great, although a lot of the threads get bogged down with topics around the group's identity, leadership, direction etc, which can become a bit distracting. </p> <p>One of these posts was around <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/altnetconf/message/7024">Martin Fowler's suggestion</a> that the group consider writing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifesto">manifesto</a> to act as a guide for the community. I like the idea for the primary reason that it may cut through the identity crisis that keeps coming up in threads (and have lead to suggestions of <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/david_laribee/archive/2007/12/11/a-proposal-for-splitting-the-alt-net-list.aspx">splitting the group</a>). I ended up <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/altnetconf/message/7365">suggesting one</a>:</p> <blockquote>"We are a group of people who are passionate about improving the way we develop software.<br>We recognise there is no single solution, but instead there are multitudes of alternatives that can be applied to different situations.<br>Our community is a place for sharing these alternatives, so that together we can learn, teach, and encourage new ideas." </blockquote> <p>That pretty much sums up what ALT.NET is about to me -- constantly learning and finding new ways to improve the way we develop software. Whether these alternatives are TDD, BDD, DDD,&nbsp;IoC,&nbsp;MVC, mocks, WebForms, Silverlight, WPF, or carrier pigeon doesn't matter. The important thing is that people are talking about them and making informed decisions that suit them and their requirements.</p> <p>I ended up getting a couple of positive responses to it, including from notables like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ayende.com/Blog/">Ayende</a>, <a href="http://graysmatter.codivation.com/">Justice</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/bsimser/">Bil</a> (<a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/altnetconf/message/7372">1</a>, <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/altnetconf/message/7414">2</a>, <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/altnetconf/message/7452">3</a>). It'll probably get lost in the flood of posts to the group, but I like the idea that anyone can contribute and potentially make a positive difference. </p> <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> This ended up on the&nbsp;<a href="http://altnetpedia.com/">ALT.NET wiki</a>, <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/altnetconf/message/7454">thanks to Bil</a> (until someone decides to remove it :-) ). Now if only I could make a contribution with my 1337 technical skillz instead of my Dilbertish mission statement generation abilities ;-)</p>
