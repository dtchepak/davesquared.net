<p>My <a href="http://davesquared.net/2007/05/launchy-application-launcher.html">favourite application launcher</a> just got better with the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=766260">release of version 2.0</a>. This release is a complete rewrite using <a href="http://trolltech.com/products/qt">QT</a>, which means it is also coming to a Linux and OSX near you!</p> <p>Not sure how if the previous versions did this, but this version seems to have really great integration with my Firefox bookmarks (including my <a href="http://davesquared.net/2007/07/firefox-keyword-searches.html">quick searches</a>). It also seems faster using the ever reliable gut-feel measurement, and now supports Vista (the previous version didn't play to well with Vista). I have to agree with the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=766260">release notes</a> that state "It's just better".</p> <p>Quick warning: the new version is incompatible with your old plugins, skins and settings, so installing 2.0 will reset Launchy to factory-defaults. </p> <p>If you weren't using <a href="http://launchy.net/">Launchy</a> before, I seriously recommend you start now. It's awesome. It's free. What more could you ask for?</p>
