<p>Playing around with an ASP.NET-hosted WCF service today. While testing using the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb552364.aspx">WCF Test Client</a> I (unsurprisingly in retrospect) got a null reference exception when trying to access <code>HttpContext.Current</code>. This completely stuffed up my attempt to get the current identity from <code>HttpContext.Current.User.Identity</code>.</p>

<p>After a quick search I found the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.servicemodel.servicesecuritycontext.aspx">ServiceSecurityContext class</a> in the <code>System.ServiceModel</code> namespace. This gives you the current identity using <code>ServiceSecurityContext.Current.PrimaryIdentity</code> (and also exposes the current <code>WindowsIdentity</code>).</p>

<p>Helpfully enough my code was well factored for once (to help with my unit testing/TDDing) and I only had to make the change in one place :)</p>

<p>Might be some more gotchas around this depending on what authentication mechanism you are using, but this was enough to get things working for me.</p>
