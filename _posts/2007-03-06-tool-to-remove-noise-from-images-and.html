<p>Seen on /., <a href="http://www.greyc.ensicaen.fr/%7Edtschump/greycstoration/demonstration.html">GREYCstoration</a> is a library and command line tool for image processing. It looks fantastic for removing noise from images, but also does some nice stuff like removing JPEG-compression artefacts, and scaling up smaller images without the normal levels of distortion. Apparently this library is used in DigiKam and Krita.</p>

<p>Another tool that sounds interesting is <a href="http://www.logarithmic.net/pfh/resynthesizer">Resynthesizer</a>, a plugin for GIMP that can help to create tileable textures and remove unwanted objects from an image.
