<p>Imagine a development methodology where everything was carved in stone before you even start coding! No longer do you have to worry about embracing change or meeting the ever-changing demands of customers - it's all right there in your documents from phrase 2! Well stop imagining, <a href="http://www.waterfall2006.com/">it is here today</a>! (Or last year, as the case may be). </p>

<p>Apparently the 2006 version of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_Model">Waterfall model</a> is adapted from the distant past, back when chicken really tasted like chicken. Unfortunately I missed the conference in 2006, but something so revolutionary is bound to get a repeat conference in 2007, and you can bet I'll be there front row and centre.</p>
