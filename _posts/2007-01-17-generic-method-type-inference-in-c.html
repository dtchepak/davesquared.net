<p>I feel like an idiot - and not for the first time either! In this case it took Resharper 2.5 to point out my mistake.</p>

<p>I have a method that looks a bit like this:</p>
<code>
public static void FillCollectionFromCommand&lt;T&gt;(IDbCommand command, ICollection&lt;T&gt; collection, ParseItemFromRecord&lt;T&gt; parser) { ... }
</code>
<p>Basically, it calls the parser function to populate a strongly typed collection from the execution of a command.</p>

<p>My method calls have looked something like this:</p>
<code>
IList&lt;Guid&gt; list = new List&lt;Guid&gt;();
Data.FillCollectionFromCommand<em>&lt;Guid&gt;</em>(command, list, getGuid);
</code>
<p>Resharper kindly pointed out that the emphasised code was redundant, because the compile infers type <code>T</code> as <code>Guid</code> from the list parameter, which we have declared as  <code>IList&lt;Guid&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>The new calls looks like this:</p>
<code>
IList&lt;Guid&gt; list = new List&lt;Guid&gt;();
Data.FillCollectionFromCommand(command, list, getGuid);
</code>
<p>This may not seem like a big deal, but it does make for much more readable code, especially when you start using types like <code>KeyValuePair&lt;Guid, String&gt;</code>, and that's why I'm bothering telling you so<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Seuss%27s_Sleep_Book">*</a>. And here's me thinking I had to wait for C# 3.0 for type inference.</p>
