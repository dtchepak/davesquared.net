<p>Just wanted to join in with the other million people that posted this today: <a href="http://ajax.asp.net/">ASP.NET AJAX 1.0</a> has been released.</p>
<p>
<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/01/23/asp-net-ajax-1-0-released.aspx">Scott Guthrie</a>  has a really good summary of the release and is worth a read.</p>
