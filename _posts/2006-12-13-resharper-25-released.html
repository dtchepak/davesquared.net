<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>JetBrains have released <a href='http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/features/index.html'>Resharper 2.5</a>, the latest version of their refactoring-and-more addin for VS.NET. The previous version slowed VS.NET 2005 on my lowly laptop to an unusable crawl. This new version is meant to have significant performance increases, so on it goes!</div>
