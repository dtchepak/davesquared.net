<p>I saw a great post today on the <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/testdrivendevelopment">TDD Yahoo! group</a>&nbsp;regarding <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/testdrivendevelopment/message/25361">test driving&nbsp;a CSV generator</a>. J.B. walks through the thought process behind each test, as well as refactoring steps. It is a very comprehensive example that is worth coding up if you (like me) are still learning TDD.</p> <p>UPDATE 2007-08-30: Corrected terminology -- the example is <em>generating</em> CSV, not <em>parsing</em> it.</p>
