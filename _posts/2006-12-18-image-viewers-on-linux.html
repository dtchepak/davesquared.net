<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>Linux.com has an article on <a href='http://applications.linux.com/article.pl?sid=06/12/06/158220'>image viewers on Linux</a>. It mentions a few alternatives to the usual digiKam and F-Spot (<a href='http://gqview.sourceforge.net/'>GQView </a>and Picasa), but one that looks really interesting is <a href='http://imgseek.net/index.html'>imgSeek</a>. It is mainly focussed on searching (including searching by similarity of images - not sure how nicely this will work but the concept is great) so it does not have image editing capability, but as I am after a good tool for organising images then that suits me fine.</div>
