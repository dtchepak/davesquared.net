Scott Adams (of <a href="http://www.dilbert.com/">Dilbert</a> fame) has a post on <a href="http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/07/writing-funny.html">Writing Funny</a>. I read some of this in one of his books (I find most of his work strangely amusing, although most of my colleagues don't. Maybe they just have taste). I'm just marking the article here in case I ever want to try being amusing in future.
