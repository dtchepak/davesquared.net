<p>I use git both at work and for personal projects. Unfortunately I always forget to properly set my <code>user.email</code> and <code>user.name</code> for new work repositories, and so I end up committing under my personal email address. No big deal, but not exactly brilliant either.</p>

<p>When this happened again recently I decided it would be the last time. Enter <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/githooks.html">Git hooks</a>. By using a pre-commit hook I now make sure I never commit to a repo with a mycompany.com remote unless the configured user email address is a mycompany.com address.</p>

<pre class="brush:ruby">
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

# Make sure that the user has a MyCompany email address before committing
# to a repository that contains a MyCompany remote.

useremail=`git config user.email`
remotes=`git remote -v`

if remotes.match(/mycompany\.com/) and not useremail.match(/mycompany\.com/) then
    puts "Pre-commit error: #{useremail.strip} is not a MyCompany email address "
    puts "but this repository has MyCompany remotes."
    puts
    exit 1
end
</pre>

<p>Obviously there's much more we could do with this (ensure non-company repos don't get commits under company email addresses for one), but this simple version solves the immediate problem.</p>

<p>This code goes in a <code>pre-commit</code> file in your repo's <code>.git/hooks</code> directory, or in your Git templates directory to apply to all future repos (<code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\share\git-core\templates\hooks</code> on my machine. You can apply it to existing repos by re-calling <code>git init</code> which will re-copy the templates). The file needs to be executable (which it is if you're running Windows :)), and you'll obviously need Ruby for this specific example.</p>

<p>For more information and some much more impressive examples of Git hooks, have a look at Glenn Gillen's post on <a href="http://rubypond.com/blog/slaying-dragons-git-bash-ruby">Slaying dragons with git, bash and ruby</a>.</p>

<p><b>Update 2011-06-15:</b> Found a nice way of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/8842663/906">setting a per-user template directory for hooks</a> on StackOverflow.</p>
