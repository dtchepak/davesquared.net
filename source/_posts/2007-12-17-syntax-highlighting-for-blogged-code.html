<p>I recently found (forget the source, a mailing list or blog comment somewhere I think) the <a href="http://duartes.org/iris/">Iris Syntax Highlighter</a>, which consists of a&nbsp;command line tool, .NET component,&nbsp;and an <a href="http://duartes.org/iris/highlight.html">online app</a> for generating highlighted source code in HTML (among other formats). It understands almost 500 syntaxes, including C#, XML, and various SQL flavours.&nbsp;</p> <p>You can download the whole lot and host it locally if you like, or just use the <a href="http://duartes.org/iris/highlight.html">hosted version</a>. It is published under a combined X11/Vim licence.</p> <p>So rather than my usual, ugly code samples, I'll now make sure I post in glorious colour. The code will probably still be ugly, but at least it will be syntax highlighted&nbsp;;-)</p>
