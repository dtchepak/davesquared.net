<p>This tripped me up for a little while, so I thought I'd post it in the hope that it will save someone else some head-scratching.</p>

<p>If you're running Ruby on Windows and trying to install a gem that uses native extensions, you may get an error like this (depending on how you got Ruby on to your machine):</p>

<pre>
$ gem install jekyll
Building native extensions.  This could take a while...
ERROR:  Error installing jekyll:
        ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

c:/Ruby191/bin/ruby.exe extconf.rb
creating Makefile

make
'make' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
</pre>

<p>Turns out the answer is quite simple: <a href="http://wiki.github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/development-kit">RubyInstaller DevKit</a>.</p>

<p>The site has the full instructions, but to give you a quick summary it is just a matter of downloading DevKit, extracting it somewhere, then running <code>ruby dk.rb init</code> followed by <code>ruby dk.rb install</code>. I was very impressed with how easy it was to get working.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
