<p>I used to have fun with this tool ages ago:</p> <p><a href="http://www.fightthebull.com/bullfighter.asp">Fight the Bull - Download Bullfighter</a> </p> <p>Originally developed by Deloitte Consulting, it is a plug-in for Office that picks up any bull^H^H^H annoying business jargon you have used. I remembered it while desperately searching for the correct spelling of the word "<a href="http://www.askoxford.com/results/?view=searchresults&amp;freesearch=remeditated&amp;branch=&amp;textsearchtype=exact">remediated</a>", then&nbsp;I suddenly&nbsp;realised that this was a stupid thing to write when I meant "fixed" (go easy on me, I have been writing documents for management consumption over the last day or two).&nbsp;</p> <p>Try running it over the following sentence:</p> <blockquote> <p>As a Centre of Excellence, we will leverage new paradigms, synergise economies of scale and provide vertical and horizontal-alignment between stakeholders.</p></blockquote> <p>Bullfighter&nbsp;comes up with some classic suggestions and comments (stakeholders? Did you mean: vampire slayers?). It is really fun to run over official communication from management types ;-)</p> <p>Granted, there are times and places for different communication styles, including jargon, but it is fun to have a laugh at some of the ridiculous terminology we come up with in pursuit of a dollar/pound/euro/yen etc.</p>
