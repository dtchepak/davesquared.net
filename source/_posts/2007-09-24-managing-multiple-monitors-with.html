<p><a title="DisplayFusion" href="http://www.binaryfortress.com/displayfusion/">DisplayFusion</a> is a free (as in beer) application&nbsp;for managing multiple monitors. It has features for setting different backgrounds per monitor, or setting a background that spans all monitors. It also&nbsp;has some hotkey settings for moving and tiling windows between monitors (I really like the Win+S shortcut to center the active window and size it to 75% of the active monitor's size). While I miss the Windows taskbar extensions that <a href="http://realtimesoft.com/ultramon/">Ultramon</a> has,&nbsp;DisplayFusion beats Ultramon on price (Ultramon is priced very reasonably anyway, but free is hard to top :-)),&nbsp;works well and is quite polished.</p> <p><a href="http://www.binaryfortress.com/displayfusion/">Binary Fortress Software Â» DisplayFusion</a></p>
