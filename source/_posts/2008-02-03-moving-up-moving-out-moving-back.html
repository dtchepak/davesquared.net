<p>After throwing myself headlong into the process of migrating my blog to a shiny new weblogs.asp.net address, I found myself a bit disillusioned with the animated banner ads that appeared on the blog over there. Seeing I'm my most frequent reader, it seemed like a bit of a waste to have ads (or gaps of whitespace for Adblock users ;-) ) on my own resource. I don't really want to be looking up some configuration setting for NHibernate to be interrupted by an animated banner telling me to buy stuff.</p> <p>So, much like George Costanza in "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Revenge_%28Seinfeld_episode%29">The Revenge</a>", I'm heading back to work and pretending nothing ever happened :-)</p> <p>One thing I have learned from the experience is to really appreciate some of the services we have like <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a>, <a href="http://www.wordpress.com">Wordpress.com</a>, <a href="http://www.feedburner.com">Feedburner</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/">Google Code</a> etc. that really offer a lot without asking much (or anything) in return. </p> <p>Another thing I learned was to look before I leap. I actually knew that already, but was blinded by my years of longing for an MVP-like blog on weblogs.asp.net, right next to <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/">Mr Gu</a>, <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/fbouma">Frans</a>, et al.</p> <p>And finally, I learned that anyone that reads my blog or blog feed, and enjoys it for some strange reason, should make sure they are subscribed to my <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/davesquared">Feedburner feed</a>, so you can continue to suffer my inane blog posts no matter where my blog is hosted. :)</p> <p>Not sure what to do with the <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/davidtchepak">old new blog</a>. I might just keep it there as a reminder to me that the grass always looks greener on the other side... :)</p>
