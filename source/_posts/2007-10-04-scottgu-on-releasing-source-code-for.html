<p>Scott has announced that the source code for the .NET Framework 3.5 will be released around the same time as VS 2008 / .NET 3.5 RTM. They will also be releasing debugging symbols so you can step through the code all the way down to the framework classes. Full announcement here:</p> <p><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/10/03/releasing-the-source-code-for-the-net-framework-libraries.aspx">Releasing the Source Code for the .NET Framework Libraries - ScottGu's Blog</a> </p> <p>This is so unbelievable awesome! Hopefully it will mean a lot more bugs get picked up, and I can imagine it really helping the <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page">Mono</a> team. It also sends a strong message about releasing or opening up source code in general -- you don't really have to worry about all your intellectual property walking out the door. The bad guys will always disassemble/reverse engineer your product anyway. By keeping it all closed you are only locking out the good guys from a better understanding and appreciation for your product, and locking yourself out from some potentially great feedback and bug reports.</p> <p>I think Scott Guthrie and his team have done a fantastic job with ASP.NET et al. over the last couple of years, and have been a huge boon to Microsoft. They really seem to reflect a new side of Microsoft, with an attitude of openness and general respect for the community which uses their products. Scott is probably the main reason why I no longer spend all my time pining to go back to Java :-)</p> <p><strong>Update: </strong><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sburke/archive/2007/10/03/making-net-framework-source-available-to-developers.aspx">Shawn Burke</a> has a good post on this, as does <a href="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2007/Oct-03.html">Miguel de Icaza</a> from the Mono project. eWeek.com also has the obligatory <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,2191754,00.asp">conspiracy theory</a>. Frans has a fairly <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/fbouma/archive/2007/10/04/don-t-look-at-the-sourcecode-of-net-licensed-under-the-reference-license.aspx">well-reasoned criticism</a> of the licence being used for the release.</p>
