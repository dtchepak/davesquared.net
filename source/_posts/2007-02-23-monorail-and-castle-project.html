<p><a href='http://www.castleproject.org/monorail/index.html'>MonoRail</a> is a Model-View-Controller framework that can be used as an alternative to standard ASP.NET WebForms. It runs on .NET 1.1/2.0 and Mono. It enforces the separation between model/data, controller and the view. There is a <a href='http://www.castleproject.org/monorail/gettingstarted/index.html'>Getting Started</a> guide that has a pretty comprehensive walk-through of a rails app, including using the built-in support for the Active Record pattern to persist objects.</p>

<p>The <a href='http://www.castleproject.org/index.html'>Castle Project</a> itself is a collection of projects for .NET web development.</p>
