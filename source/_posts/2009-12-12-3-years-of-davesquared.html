<p>Wow, it feels like only a year ago I was celebrating <a href="http://davesquared.net/2008/12/happy-2nd-blogoversary.html">two years of writing my blog</a>. :P That's right, I've now been slaving over my little corner of the intraweb for 3 years. From <a href="http://davesquared.net/2006/12/first-post.html">humble beginnings</a> as a naive, new blogger with virtually no readers, the intervening three years have seen me grow into a naive, old blogger with virtually no readers.</p>

<p>In all seriousness though, thanks to everyone that has subscribed and/or stopped by for a visit. I really appreciate it. An extra big thanks goes to those who have taken the time to leave comments.</p>

<p>If you'd like to give me a Happy Blogsday present, I'd love to get a comment from you so I can see who's crazy enough to subscribe to my ramblings. That or an iPhone -- completely up to you.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to posting more ramblings in the year ahead.</p>

<p>Best regards,<br/>David</p>
