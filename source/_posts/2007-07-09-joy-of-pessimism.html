<a href="http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/38892.html">Great quote</a> on my iGoogle homepage today:<blockquote>The nice part about being a pessimist is that you are constantly being either proven right or pleasantly surprised.
<i>-- George F. Will (US editor, commentator, and columnist)</i></blockquote>
Amen George :-)
