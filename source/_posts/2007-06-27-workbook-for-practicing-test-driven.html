<p>Brian Marick has a draft&nbsp;<a title="Exploration Through Example &raquo; Blog Archive &raquo; A workbook for practicing test-driven design (draft)" href="http://www.exampler.com/blog/2007/06/26/a-workbook-for-practicing-test-driven-design-draft/">exercise</a>&nbsp;available for learning TDD. The workbook starts off with some basic requirements and an overview of the classes and test fixtures you will need. It then gets the reader to implement a number of changes, test first, presumably to illustrate the relative ease of modifying test driven code.</p>
