<p>In the <a href="http://davesquared.net/2010/11/replacing-ruby-instance-method-with.html">last post</a> we looked at the hoops we had to go through to redefine a method on a single instance using a closure. In this post we'll look at ways to make this easier on ourselves.</p>

<p>I should stress that I'm a Ruby n00bie, so take this all with a grain of salt. Please let me know if I've got it wrong.</p>

<h2>First attempt</h2>
<p>We found out last time that to add an instance method to a single object using a closure we had to obtain a reference to that instance's <i>metaclass</i> (or <i>eigenclass</i> as it is also known) using the <code>class &lt;&lt; instance</code> syntax. We could then use the metaclass's private <code>define_method</code> via the <code>send</code> method.</p>
<pre class="brush: ruby">
class Greeter
    def say_hello
        puts "Hello World!"
    end
end
greeters_metaclass = class &lt;&lt; greeter; self; end
greeters_metaclass.send(:define_method, :say_hello) do
    puts "G'day #{name}"
end
greeter.say_hello
#=&gt; G'day Anonymous Dave
</pre>

<p>We can make this a bit easier by extracting this into a method. If we put it in a Ruby <i>module</i>, we can open up any class or instance and import this code as required.</p>

<pre class="brush: ruby">
module Meta
    def define(name, &block)
        meta = class &lt;&lt; self; self; end
        meta.send(:define_method, name, block)
    end
end
</pre>

<p>And this works the same way as the previous code, just a bit neater:</p>

<pre class="brush: ruby">
# Open up Greeter class and import the Meta module:
class Greeter
    include Meta
end

# Our greeter gains the new syntax:
name = "Anonymous Dave"
greeter.define(:say_hello) do
    puts "G'day #{name}"
end

greeter.say_hello
#=&gt; G'day Anonymous Dave
</pre>
<p>We can do better.</p>

<h2>Second attempt</h2>
<p>It would be really nice to be able to just write <code>greeter.define.say_hello { puts "blah" }</code>. Let's make it work. We'll need to make a <code>define</code> method that returns some sort of object that responds to any method, whether it exists or not. Ruby has a handy <code>method_missing</code> method we can define which will be invoked in the event it cannot resolve a particular method. We can just move the method creation into there:</p>

<pre class="brush: ruby">
module Meta
    def define
        meta = class &lt;&lt; self; self; end
        Creator.new(meta)
    end
    class Creator
        def initialize(meta)
            @meta = meta
        end
        def method_missing(symbol, *args, &block)
            @meta.send(:define_method, symbol, block)
        end
    end
end
</pre>

<p>This then gives us a nicer syntax whenever we import the module:</p>

<pre class="brush: ruby">
name = "Anonymous Dave"
greeter.define.say_hello do
    puts "G'day #{name}"
end
greeter.say_hello
#=&gt; G'day Anonymous Dave


greeter.define.say_hello do
    puts "Howdy!"
end
greeter.say_hello
#=&gt; Howdy!
</pre>

<h2>Parting thoughts</h2>
<p>Like I said, I'm new to this stuff and have absolutely no idea if this is completely terrible. I do know that I'm really impressed with how easily even a newbie like me could add the syntax I wanted to absolutely everywhere in Ruby I could possibly need it, in a fairly neat and reusable way.</p>
