<p>There are many challenges a developer faces when working for a company that is not in the business of producing software. I recently found Jacob's <a href="http://scruffylookingcatherder.com/Default.aspx">Scruffy-Looking Cat Herder blog</a>, which has a few posts relating to this topic:</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://scruffylookingcatherder.com/archive/2007/09/06/small-company-development.aspx">Small Company Development</a></li> <li><a href="http://scruffylookingcatherder.com/archive/2007/12/13/dependency-injection-house-call.aspx">Dependency Injection House Call</a></li></ul> <p>Jacob writes about just how important the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAGNI">YAGNI</a> concept is in these environments, and also why <a href="http://scruffylookingcatherder.com/archive/2007/12/13/dependency-injection-house-call.aspx">in-house development doesn't have to suck</a> (in contrast to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/12/04.html">Joel's suggestion</a>).</p>
