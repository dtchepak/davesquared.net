<p>Alberto Savoia's contribution to the O'Reilly-published <a href="http://beautifulcode.oreillynet.com/">Beautiful Code</a> is about writing <a title="beautiful tests" href="http://www.junitfactory.com/articles/beautiful-code/">beautiful tests</a>. The chapter is <a title="available online" href="http://www.junitfactory.com/articles/beautiful-code/">available online</a> and features a walk-through of testing a binary search implementation in Java.</p> <p>This might be a good TDD exercise -- test drive the implementation and then compare notes/tests with Alberto's article.</p>
