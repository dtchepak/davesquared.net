<p>After <a href="http://davesquared.net/2007/08/first-impressions-of-vista.html">using Vista for a while</a> I was having trouble switching back to the Windows-XP version of Windows Explorer at work. I especially missed the bread crumb that makes it really easy to go to different folders along the current path.</p> <p>There had to be an alternative out there. Turns out <a href="http://www.simplehelp.net/2006/10/11/10-windows-explorer-alternatives-compared-and-reviewed/">there are a few</a>, but one that is free and has a bread crumb bar is <a href="http://www.mustangpeak.net/subdomains/ultraexplorer/index.html">UltraExplorer</a>. It is very customisable, has loads of features,&nbsp;and seems quite usable in my experience so far.</p>
