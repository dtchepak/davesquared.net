<p>I was asked this question today: is there an easy way (i.e. single method call) to convert the row values for a particular DataColumn of a DataTable into a String array. I don't necessarily recommend doing this, but yes:</p>
<pre>
String[] rowValuesForColumn =
 Array.ConvertAll&lt;DataRow, String&gt;(
   dataTable.Select(),
   delegate(DataRow row) { return (String) row[columnName]; }
 );
</pre>
<p>You can obviously package all this into a generic method to convert to any type of array.</p>
