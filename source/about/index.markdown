My name's David Tchepak, and I'm a software developer in Sydney, Australia.  I write about my various adventures in programming and attempts to improve the way I develop software on this blog. I also do a bit of [open source stuff](https://github.com/dtchepak).
  
Feel free to email [me@davesquared.net](mailto:me@davesquared.net), or [find me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/davetchepak).
